# FAQS

We would like to answer some common questions about the use of CDC Period Linked Birth-Infant Death Data Files and the methodology involved in analyzing these files to compare neonatal mortality rates among infants born at the hospital versus those born at home.

### Question
What is Period Linked Birth-Infant Death Data?

### Answer
The linked Birth/Infant Death data set links information from the birth certificate to information from the death certificate for each infant death in the United States. The purpose of the linkage is to provide a data set that adds the many additional variables from the birth certificate to the death certificate record to enable more detailed analyses of infant mortality patterns. The linked file is used for calculating infant mortality rates by race and ethnicity, which are more accurately measured from birth certificate data than from data on the death certificate. *(Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics (CDC/NCHS))*

### Question
Is this a reliable data set to use for this type of analysis?

### Answer
We based our data analysis on previous, peer-reviewed published studies by Amos Grunebaum, an obstetrician-gynecologist affiliated with New York-Presbyterian Hospital. 

“There are dozens of peer-reviewed publications in the medical literature using the CDC birth certificate data to explore pregnancy outcomes including those at planned home births," Grunebaum said. "The CDC database is a comprehensive database and the best database in the world to assess births outcomes with over 100 variables.”

### Question
Don't all states collect different information on their birth certificates? Doesn't that make it tricky to analyze the data?

### Answer
Birth certificates from all 50 states and the District of Columbia track births by attendant (such as physician, certified nurse midwife or other type of midwife) and setting (such as hospital, freestanding birth center or home). In addition, all birth certificates ask whether a home birth was planned or unplanned, allowing for further refinement of the data. 

### Question
So your data analysis looked only as home births in which the "planned" box was checked and excluded all others?

### Answer
Following Grunebaum’s methodology, we analyzed only home births in which the attendant was a midwife, indicating that it was planned and attended by a professional. (All home births in which the attendant was not a midwife were excluded because of the potential they were unintended home births.) 

We then went beyond that to analyze the numbers a second time including only home births in which the “planned” box was actually checked.  Although this question first appeared in the CDC’s 2003 Revision of the U.S. Certificate of Live Birth, states did not universally adopt those revisions until 2015. Because our analysis examined births between 2006 and 2015, this data point isn’t perfectly reliable. Nevertheless, when we invoked it, we found that although the raw number of births and deaths varied slightly, the findings were identical in every scenario.

Home births with a midwife resulted in three times as many infant deaths during or within a month of delivery than a hospital birth with a midwife, according to both analyses. For babies of first-time moms, that rate was four times as high, according to both analyses. When restricting that analysis to one week, the rate was six times higher, according to both analyses. And for babies of first time-moms, it was eight times higher, according to both analyses. 

Here is a screen shot showing the results of the two analyses. 
"Home midwife (1)" = all home births attended by a midwife
"Home midwife (2)" = home births attended by a midwife where the "planned" box was checked.
