# FAQS

We would like to answer some common questions about the use of CDC Period Linked Birth-Infant Death Data Files and the methodology involved in analyzing these files to compare neonatal mortality rates among infants born at the hospital versus those born at home.

### Question
What is Period Linked Birth-Infant Death Data?

### Answer
The linked Birth/Infant Death data set links information from the birth certificate to information from the death certificate for each infant death in the United States. The purpose of the linkage is to provide a data set that adds the many additional variables from the birth certificate to the death certificate record to enable more detailed analyses of infant mortality patterns. The linked file is used for calculating infant mortality rates by race and ethnicity, which are more accurately measured from birth certificate data than from data on the death certificate. *(Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics (CDC/NCHS))*

### Question
Is this a reliable data set to use for this type of analysis?

### Answer
We based our data analysis on previous, peer-reviewed published studies by Amos Grunebaum, an obstetrician-gynecologist affiliated with New York-Presbyterian Hospital. 

“There are dozens of peer-reviewed publications in the medical literature using the CDC birth certificate data to explore pregnancy outcomes including those at planned home births," Grunebaum said. "The CDC database is a comprehensive database and the best database in the world to assess births outcomes with over 100 variables.”

### Question
Don't all states collect different information on their birth certificates? Doesn't that make it tricky to analyze the data?

### Answer
Birth certificates from all 50 states and the District of Columbia track births by attendant (such as physician, certified nurse midwife or other type of midwife) and setting (such as hospital, freestanding birth center or home). These are the two main criteria we used to distinguish the differnt types of in-hospital and out-of-hospital births. Specifically, we divided our analysis into: hospital births attended by physicians; hospital births attended by midwives; home births attended by midwives; freestanding birth center births attended by midwives.

We further refined our analysis by including only infants who were carried full term (37+ weeks gestation), weighing at least 2,500 grams (5.8 pounds), who were singletons (not twins or multiples), had no congenital or chromosomal anomalies (which heightened the risk they would have died anyway), and born to U.S. mothers. This is the same criteria Grunebaum used.

### Question
Some home births are not intentional, though. How did you distinguish between planned home births and unplanned home births? 

### Answer
Following Grunebaum’s methodology, we analyzed only home births in which the attendant was a midwife, indicating that it was planned. (All home births in which the attendant was not a midwife were excluded because of the potential they were unintended home births.) It is possible that someone intended to have a hospital birth, but the baby came too quickly, and the family was able to call a midwife to rush to the house to assist. These cases would be included in our analysis. 

There is also a question on all birth certificates that, in the case of a home birth, asks whether it was planned or unplanned. Although this question first appeared in the CDC’s 2003 Revision of the U.S. Certificate of Live Birth, states did not universally adopt those revisions until 2015. Because our analysis examined births between 2006 and 2015, this data point isn’t perfectly reliable. Nevertheless, when we invoked it, we found that although the raw number of births and deaths varied slightly, the findings were identical in every scenario.

#### Here is a screen shot showing the results of the two analyses.
"Home midwife (1)" = all home births attended by a midwife

"Home midwife (2)" = home births attended by a midwife where the "planned" box was checked.

### Question 
Did you distinguish between certified nurse midwives and non-nurse midwives?

### Answer
Again, following Grunebaum's methodology, we did not separate the two types of midwives for this analysis. We were interested only in comparing midwife-assited out-of-hospital births with midwife-assisted in-hospital births. 

However, we did perform a second analysis comparing out-of-hospital delivery outcomes only beween the two different types of midwives. For this analysis, we used the PLBID via the CDC WONDER portal and looked at all out-of-hospital deliveries between 2007-2016 of full-term (37+ week) babies weighing at least 2,500 grams who were singletons (not twins or multiples), had no congenital or chromosomal anomalies and who died within 27 days of birth. 

#### Results of that analysis:
**Certified Nurse Midwives:** 131,867 births | 67 deaths | **5.1 deaths/10K births**

**Other (non-nurse) Midwives:** 176,819 births | 158 deaths | **8.9 deaths/10K births**

It's also important here to note that while the number of certified nurse midwives far exceeds that of non-nurse midwives in the United States, it is non-nurse midwives who attend the majority of out-of-hospital births (nearly 60 percent). Ninety-five percent of all CNM-attended births occur in a hospital, CDC data show.

### Question 
Not all non-nurse midwives are licensed. Did your analysis distinguish between licensed and unlicensed non-nurse midwives? 

### Answer
The CDC does not collect that information, so we were unable to separate licensed non-nurse midwives from unlicensed non-nurse midwives. (All nurses - included certifeid nurse midwives - must be licensed to legally practice in every state. That is not the case with non-nurse midwives, who are unregulated in at least 12 states and banned in four others, plus the District of Columbia.) Nor could we distinguish between credentialed midwives and uncredentialed midwives.
