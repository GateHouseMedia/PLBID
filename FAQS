# FAQS 

We would like to answer some common questions about the use of CDC Period Linked Birth-Infant Death Data Files and the methodology involved in analyzing these files to compare neonatal mortality rates among infants born at the hospital versus those born at home. 

### What is Period Linked Birth-Infant Death Data? 

### Answer
The linked Birth/Infant Death data set links information from the birth certificate to information from the death certificate for each infant death in the United States. The purpose of the linkage is to provide a data set that adds the many additional variables from the birth certificate to the death certificate record to enable more detailed analyses of infant mortality patterns. The linked file is used for calculating infant mortality rates by race and ethnicity, which are more accurately measured from birth certificate data than from data on the death certificate.
